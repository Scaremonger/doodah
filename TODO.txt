BUGS:
Cannot create service file unless sudo....
Should copy from somewhere, check we have sudo!
doodah/bin/doodah.service

IMPROVEMENTS
* Get version number from setup file instead of hard coding

THINGS TO DO:
* finish:
    enable, disable
    start, stop, restart, status
    help
    (run python)

NOTES:
Preload Skin Names must have "/" and "." replaced with underscore
, this needs a "Slug" function.

doodah.ini / [skin] / 
    windowx,y can be %, R, B
    anchorx,y   - Not implemented
    
START THE UPDATE CYCLE
* Update Measures
    Thsi will give each measure a value
* Update Meters
    This will update DOM objects contents and size
* Update All DOM objects positions 
    Because they are based on size of previous etc.
