BUGS:
* Test missing.png
* Images are displayed full size and not size of container.
* img meter skin does not resize around the image!

THESE ARE REDUNDANT:
    @app.route('/$Layout=<layout>')
    @app.route('/$Skin=<skin>')
REMOVE THEM FROM JS AND REPLACE IN PYTHON

* When skin does not exist, create one anyway of type "missing skin"
    Use location from layout file and size if known
    Must be generated, Not a physical skin
        because we need to add text to "text=" inside meter.
* LAYOUT FILE With key=value outside section crashes it.
* SKIN FILE With key=value outside section crashes it.
* In doodah_server.onreadystatechange():
    Invalid layouts should display an error message, maybe an error Meter?
    Invalid skins should create a error skin with the error message
* Requests for Skins/Layouts containing spaces adds a %20 into the URL which is not removed.
* Requests for skins are lowercase

  
IMPROVEMENTS
------------
* Get version number from setup file instead of hard coding
* favicon.ico - If it exists, use the one in layout folder
* Check if skin file or layout file actually exists before retruning 404
    (Return an empty file in it's place)

THINGS TO DO:
* finish:
    enable, disable
    start, stop, restart, status
    help
    (run python)

NOTES:
Preload Skin Names must have "/" and "." replaced with underscore
, this needs a "Slug" function.

doodah.ini / [skin] / 
    windowx,y can be %, R, B
    anchorx,y   - Not implemented
    
START THE UPDATE CYCLE
* Update Measures
    Thsi will give each measure a value
* Update Meters
    This will update DOM objects contents and size
* Update All DOM objects positions 
    Because they are based on size of previous etc.
